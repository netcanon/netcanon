## [Unreleased]

### Changed (diff page: directional paradigm — `FROM → TO`)

- **"Sides" paradigm replaced with a temporally-neutral direction.**
  The unified diff layout has directionality (`+N` added / `-M`
  removed going from one file to another), not sides.  The UI now
  surfaces that explicitly with `FROM` and `TO` role labels:
  - Each filename chip is preceded by a role badge: `FROM` (dark)
    next to the left chip, `TO` (green) next to the right chip.
  - A directional arrow (`→`) replaces the neutral "vs".
  - The stats strip is prefixed `from → to:` so `+12 / −3` reads
    naturally ("12 added, 3 removed going from the left file to the
    right file").
  - The `⇄ Swap sides` button becomes `⇋ Reverse direction`; its
    tooltip explains that the click swaps FROM/TO.
- **Why `from`/`to` instead of `baseline`/`current`?**  `current`
  implied one of the configs was from "now", which is wrong when you
  diff two old configs against each other.  `from`/`to` encodes only
  direction, not time — perfect for any pairwise comparison whether
  both configs are historical, both are fresh, or mixed.
- **Testid renames:**
  - `diff-swap-sides-btn` → `diff-reverse-btn`
  - New testids: `diff-from-label`, `diff-to-label`
- **Helper / test updates:** `DiffPage.swap_sides_btn` →
  `DiffPage.reverse_btn`; `test_swap_sides_link_reverses_url` →
  `test_reverse_direction_link_reverses_url`; new assertion
  `test_from_and_to_role_labels_visible`.

### Added (diff: collapsed-context folding for large configs)

- **Context folding** on `/configs/{left}/vs/{right}`.  Long runs of
  equal lines far from any change are squashed into a single expandable
  "… N unchanged lines …" marker, matching the convention used by git,
  GitHub, GitLab and VS Code.  Drops a real-world FortiGate vs
  FortiGate comparison from **35,422 rendered `<div>`s** to **~900** —
  a ~32× reduction in browser layout cost.
- **Zero-round-trip expansion.**  Every collapsed marker ships a
  sibling `<template>` element carrying the hidden lines as
  pre-rendered markup.  Clicking the marker clones the fragment into
  the DOM in place of the marker, applies syntax highlighting to the
  new lines, and removes the marker + template.  No network call, no
  flash of unstyled content.
- Keyboard-accessible: markers are `<button>`s so Tab / Enter / Space
  all work.
- **New model:** `netconfig.models.diff.DiffGroup` — `{kind, lines}`
  where ``kind`` is the per-line classification or the new
  ``"collapsed"`` group.
- **New service:** `netconfig.services.diff.fold_context(lines,
  context=3)` — pure, two-sweep Manhattan-style distance-to-change
  computation.  Default context (`3` lines) matches unified-diff
  convention.
- **New testids:** `diff-line-collapsed`, `diff-collapsed-template`.
- **Tests:** 9 new unit tests in `tests/unit/test_diff_service.py`
  exercising the folding algorithm (boundaries, adjacent changes,
  context=0, default=3, negative rejected, order preservation).
  3 new E2E tests in `TestDiffContextFolding` covering marker
  visibility, count attribute, and click-to-expand behaviour.

### Added (config diff — Tier 1 textual line diff with compatibility guardrails)

- **`POST /api/v1/configs/diff`** — line-level unified diff between two
  stored configurations.  Body: `{left, right, force?}`.  Returns a
  `DiffReport` containing the per-line breakdown, aggregate stats
  (`{added, removed, equal}`), and a compatibility report.  Uses
  stdlib `difflib.SequenceMatcher`; no new runtime dependencies.
- **Compatibility guardrails (defence in depth).**  Two configs are
  considered diff-compatible when `type_key` (`device_type`) AND
  `file_extension` match on both records.  Mismatches:
  - API refuses with **HTTP 422** unless the caller explicitly passes
    `force=true` in the body.
  - UI: the "Compare" button on `/configs` opens a target picker that
    lists only matching configs by default; cross-vendor options are
    hidden behind a "Show cross-vendor" toggle and dimmed.
  - `/configs/{left}/vs/{right}` page always renders, but an
    incompatible pair without `?force=true` gets a red block banner
    and a "Compare anyway" override button in place of the diff body.
  - With `force=true` the diff is computed anyway; a red banner warns
    semantic equivalence is not guaranteed.
- **Deep-linkable diff URL** at `/configs/{left}/vs/{right}` (with
  optional `?force=true`).  Reuses the config viewer's syntax
  highlighter client-side — each diff line's `<span>` goes through
  `_cvRenderHighlighted(text, ext)` post-render so cfg/xml colouring
  stays consistent between the viewer and the diff view.
- **Compare button** on every row of `/configs`; lightweight modal
  picker keyed on `type_key` + `file_extension`.
- **New models:** `netconfig.models.diff.{DiffLine, CompatibilityReport,
  DiffRequest, DiffReport}`.  **New service:**
  `netconfig.services.diff.{check_compatibility, compute_diff}` — pure,
  no I/O, easily testable.
- **New tests:**
  - `tests/unit/test_diff_service.py` (12 tests): pure-function tests
    for compat logic, add/remove/replace, force annotation, empty input,
    trailing-newline handling.
  - `tests/integration/test_configs_api.py::TestDiffCompatibility` +
    `::TestDiffOutput` (8 tests): same-type OK, cross-vendor 422,
    force override, 404 on missing filename, line-number monotonicity.
  - `tests/e2e/test_backup_flow.py::TestDiffApi` +
    `::TestDiffPageUI` + `::TestDiffPageContent` (13 tests): live-API
    wiring, Compare button and picker, cross-vendor hide/show, banner
    severity, force override, swap-sides link.
- **New testids** for Compare picker and the diff page; see
  `tests/testid_reference.md`.

### Fixed (config viewer search misses queries that cross syntax-highlight spans)

- **Cross-span search now works.** The syntax highlighter splits the
  config text into many text nodes interleaved with ``<span class="tok-*">``
  elements.  The previous per-text-node ``indexOf`` loop couldn't see a
  match that straddled a span boundary, so queries like ``64:ff9b``
  (FortiGate IPv6 NAT prefix — ``64`` is a ``tok-number`` span, ``:ff9b``
  is plain text in the next node) or ``hostname Router`` (keyword span
  followed by plain text) silently returned zero matches even when the
  substring was clearly present.
- **Fix:** ``_cvSearch`` in ``base.html`` now flattens the ``<pre>`` into
  a single string while building a ``(node, absolute_offset)`` segment
  map, finds matches in the flat text, and wraps each match across
  whatever boundaries it crosses.  Matches are processed in reverse
  document order so earlier offsets stay valid as later ones mutate
  the DOM.  A single logical match becomes a *group* of ``<mark>``
  elements; ``configViewerNav`` toggles the ``.current`` class on every
  element in the group and scrolls to the first.
- **New E2E tests** in ``tests/e2e/test_backup_flow.py``:
  - ``test_cross_span_query_finds_match`` — asserts ``"hostname Router"``
    (straddles the ``tok-keyword`` span) now matches.
  - ``test_cross_span_match_current_class_applied_to_all_pieces`` —
    asserts every ``<mark>`` in the group gets ``.current``.

### Added (parallel backup execution within a job)

- **Per-job parallelism** — `_run_backup_job` now dispatches device work
  to a bounded `ThreadPoolExecutor`.  Up to `backup_concurrency` devices
  run simultaneously; additional devices wait in the executor's FIFO
  queue and start as slots free up.  A 30-device job with 30 s per
  device now completes in ~3 × the per-device latency instead of 30 ×.
- **`Settings.backup_concurrency`** — new configurable, range `[1, 10]`,
  default `10`.  Hard-capped at `MAX_BACKUP_CONCURRENCY = 10` in
  `netconfig/config.py` to protect target SSH servers (most vendor caps
  are 5–16) and bound server thread count.  Override via
  `NETCONFIG_BACKUP_CONCURRENCY`; see `.env.example`.
- **Serial fast-path** — jobs with a single device (or deployments
  pinned to `backup_concurrency=1`) skip the thread pool entirely;
  traces and error paths stay unchanged for those callers.
- **Thread-safety contract** documented in the `_run_backup_job`
  docstring: results list is pre-populated and never resized, each
  worker mutates exactly one index, and `FileConfigStore` atomic writes
  handle storage concurrency.
- Tests default to serial execution (`test_settings` sets
  `backup_concurrency=1`) so the existing observation test and all
  ordering-sensitive assertions remain deterministic.  Explicit parallel
  tests in `TestBackupConcurrency` exercise the pool via `Barrier(n)`.

### Added (persistent backup-progress panel + per-device lifecycle states)

- **`BackupResult.status` lifecycle** — new intermediate values `queued`
  and `running` alongside the existing terminal `success` / `failed`.
  `_run_backup_job` now pre-populates one `BackupResult` per device in
  `queued` state, flips each to `running` when its collector is invoked,
  and sets the terminal state on completion.  Polling clients can snapshot
  the results list at any point and see exactly which device the engine is
  working on.
- **Floating job-progress panel** (`base.html` — global):
  - Bottom-right floating widget, present on every page.
  - Collapsible header showing aggregated job status + live summary
    (`2/5 complete — running: 1 — queued: 2` or `5/5 succeeded`).
  - One row per device with status icon (`○` queued, `⟳` running, `✓`
    success, `✗` failed), host label, per-device duration, and truncated
    error on failure.
  - **Persists across full page reloads** — the active job ID is stored
    in `localStorage["netconfig.activeJob"]`; on `DOMContentLoaded` the
    panel resumes polling if the stored job is still non-terminal, and
    renders the final state otherwise.
  - Explicit `Dismiss` button (no auto-dismiss) clears the panel AND the
    localStorage key.  A "View full job details" deep link jumps to the
    corresponding card on `/jobs`.
  - Dispatches `netconfig:job-started`, `netconfig:job-progress`,
    `netconfig:job-complete`, and `netconfig:job-dismissed` `CustomEvent`s
    on `document` so page-level code (e.g. the dashboard row injector)
    can react without re-polling.
- **New `data-testid`s:** `job-progress-panel`, `job-progress-header`,
  `job-progress-summary`, `job-progress-toggle`, `job-progress-body`,
  `job-progress-device-row`, `job-progress-device-status`,
  `job-progress-device-host`, `job-progress-device-duration`,
  `job-progress-device-error`, `job-progress-footer`,
  `job-progress-view-link`, `job-progress-dismiss`.  The legacy
  `job-status-banner`, `job-id-display`, and `job-status-display` testids
  are aliased onto the new panel for backward compatibility.

### Removed

- **Inline job status banner** on `index.html` — replaced by the global
  floating progress panel (above).  The dashboard's submit handler now
  delegates to `startJobProgress(jobId)` and listens for the
  `netconfig:job-complete` event for the "inject a row into the recent
  jobs table" step.

### Added (config viewer: syntax highlighting + in-modal search)

- **Syntax highlighting** in the shared config viewer modal (`viewConfig()`):
  comments, keywords, strings, IP addresses, and numbers for Cisco / Fortigate /
  Mikrotik `.cfg` output, plus tags and attributes for OPNsense XML.  Unknown
  extensions fall back to escaped plain text.  Palette is VS Code "Dark+"
  inspired; all tokens are rendered as `<span class="tok-*">` so E2E tests and
  custom themes can target them.
- **In-modal search** with live match counter, previous / next navigation
  (▲ / ▼ buttons), keyboard shortcuts (Enter = next, Shift+Enter = previous,
  Escape = clear or close), and wrap-around.  Matches are wrapped in `<mark>`
  elements; the currently-selected match gets `mark.current` for a distinct
  highlight colour and is auto-scrolled into view.
- **New `data-testid`s** for the viewer: `config-viewer`, `config-viewer-title`,
  `config-viewer-content`, `config-viewer-search`, `config-viewer-search-count`,
  `config-viewer-search-prev`, `config-viewer-search-next`, `config-viewer-close`.
  Full reference in `tests/testid_reference.md`.

### Changed (job status reflects per-device outcomes)

- **`JobStatus.partial`** — new terminal state for backup jobs where at least
  one device succeeded AND at least one failed.  Terminal-state semantics are
  now:
  - `completed` — every device succeeded.
  - `partial`   — mixed result (≥1 success, ≥1 failure).
  - `failed`    — zero successes (every device failed).

  Previously a job was marked `completed` regardless of per-device outcomes;
  users had to look at the success/total column to notice failures.  The UI
  now shows an amber `badge-partial` and a ⚠ indicator for mixed runs.

### Added (backup jobs page + recurring schedules)

- **Job persistence** — `FileJobStore` writes one JSON file per completed backup
  job to `{data_root}/jobs/`.  All jobs are reloaded into `app.state.jobs` at
  startup, so job history survives server restarts.
- **`BackupJob.schedule_id` / `schedule_name`** — new optional fields track
  which schedule triggered a job (snapshot of name at run time).  `None` for
  manually triggered runs.
- **`GET /jobs`** — dedicated Jobs page listing all backup jobs newest-first.
  Each job is a collapsible card showing: short ID, status badge, success/total
  count, timestamp, duration, and trigger (schedule name or "Manual").  Expanded
  body shows a per-device results table with View / Download / (Open) links and
  the config filename.  URL hash navigation: `/jobs#a1b2c3d4` auto-expands and
  scrolls to the matching job card.
- **`/schedules`** — Schedule management page and backing API:
  - **`GET /api/v1/schedules/`** — list all schedules
  - **`POST /api/v1/schedules/`** — create a recurring backup schedule
    (name, interval\_minutes, devices list)
  - **`DELETE /api/v1/schedules/{id}`** — delete a schedule
  - **`POST /api/v1/schedules/{id}/toggle`** — enable / disable a schedule
- **`BackupSchedule` model** (`netconfig/models/schedule.py`) — stores schedule
  metadata: id, name, enabled, interval\_minutes, devices, created\_at,
  last\_run\_at, next\_run\_at, last\_job\_id.
- **`FileScheduleStore`** (`netconfig/storage/schedule_store.py`) — persists
  schedule definitions as JSON under `{data_root}/schedules/`.
- **APScheduler integration** — `AsyncIOScheduler` (timezone=UTC) is started in
  the app lifespan.  Each enabled schedule registers an `IntervalTrigger` job.
  Blocking SSH runs via `asyncio.to_thread` so it never blocks the event loop.
  Scheduler state is purely in-memory; schedule definitions are re-loaded from
  disk and re-registered on every startup.
- **`next_run_at` tracking** — captured from APScheduler after registration and
  after each run; persisted to disk so the Schedules page always shows an
  accurate value even before the first tick.
- **Nav updated** — "Jobs" and "Schedules" links added between Dashboard and
  Configs in the nav bar (order: Dashboard | Jobs | Schedules | Configs |
  Definitions | API Docs).  Swagger nav updated to match.
- **`apscheduler>=3.10.4`** added to `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`.

### Added (nav bar on API Docs page)

- **`GET /docs`** — FastAPI's built-in Swagger UI is now replaced by a
  custom route that injects the NetConfig nav bar (sticky, same style as
  all other pages) so users can always navigate back from the API explorer.
  The raw `/openapi.json` schema endpoint is unchanged.  `/redoc` is
  disabled (it was unreachable from the UI anyway).

### Changed (vendor-specific field naming)

- **`ConnectionConfig.handle_paging` → `cisco_more_paging`** — renamed to make
  clear this flag controls Cisco `--More--` space-injection specifically.
  `terminal length 0` remains deliberately avoided on all Cisco definitions.
- **`ConnectionConfig.needs_shell_menu` → `opnsense_shell_menu`** — renamed to
  make clear this flag detects and dismisses the OPNsense numbered console menu
  (sends `"8"` to enter the shell).  Not applicable to any other current vendor.
- **`ConnectionConfig.needs_enable`** — unchanged.  Enable/privileged-mode
  escalation is a cross-vendor concept in Netmiko (Cisco IOS, HP ProCurve,
  Aruba OS-CX, and others).
- Updated all four YAML definition files, both collectors, all test YAML strings,
  `tests/fixtures/definitions.py`, `Get-NetworkConfigs.ps1`,
  `Test-NetworkConfigs.ps1`, and all README/doc files to match.

### Added (config storage & open-in-editor)

- **Subdirectory storage layout** — config files are now saved under
  `{device_type}/{safe_host}/` inside `configs_dir` instead of a flat root.
  Example: `configs/Cisco/192-168-1-1/Cisco_192-168-1-1_20260414_120000.cfg`.
  The self-describing filename format is unchanged.
- **Startup migration** — `FileConfigStore.__init__` automatically moves any
  flat files left by older versions into the correct subdirectory.  Non-config
  files (log files, README) are left untouched.
- **Collision safety** — if two backups of the same device complete within the
  same second, a numeric suffix is appended (`…_1.cfg`, `…_2.cfg`, …) so no
  file is ever silently overwritten.
- **`resolve_path(filename)`** — new public method on `BaseConfigStore` and
  `FileConfigStore`.  Returns the absolute filesystem path for a given filename,
  checking the subdirectory location first then falling back to the root for
  files that pre-date migration.
- **`Settings.open_in_editor: bool = False`** — new flag.  When `True`, enables
  the `POST /api/v1/configs/{filename}/open` endpoint.  Set to `True` in
  `netconfig_desktop/settings.py`.  Can also be enabled for local web
  deployments via `NETCONFIG_OPEN_IN_EDITOR=true`.
- **`POST /api/v1/configs/{filename}/open`** — opens the named config file in
  the OS default text editor (`os.startfile` on Windows, `open` on macOS,
  `xdg-open` on Linux).  Returns 204 on success; 403 if disabled; 404 if not
  found; 500 if the OS refuses to open the file.  Documented as desktop-only
  in `CLAUDE.md`; the web equivalent is the existing View button.
- **"Open" button** (`data-testid="config-open-btn"`) — appears in the Actions
  column of the Configs page only when `open_in_editor=True`.  Calls the open
  endpoint; shows a success or error toast via `showToast()`.

### Tests (config storage & open-in-editor)

- `tests/unit/test_storage.py` — 19 new/updated tests: subdirectory save,
  collision safety (triple-collision), `resolve_path` (subdir + flat fallback +
  missing), startup migration (multiple files, non-config left in place,
  idempotent), and `rglob`-based listing.  Existing tests updated to use
  `store.resolve_path()` instead of manually constructing paths.
- `tests/integration/test_configs_api.py` — `TestOpenConfig` (5 tests): 403
  when disabled, 404 for missing file, 204 on success, correct path passed to
  `os.startfile`, 500 when OS refuses.
- `tests/testid_reference.md` — `config-open-btn` added with conditional
  visibility note.

---

### Added (logging)

- **`netconfig/logging_config.py`** — New `configure_logging(level, log_file)` function.
  Sets up a `StreamHandler` (stderr) plus an optional `RotatingFileHandler` (5 MB, 3
  backups) on the root logger.  Idempotent: skips when real (non-pytest) handlers are
  already present.  Suppresses `paramiko`, `uvicorn.access`, `multipart`, and `asyncio`
  to `WARNING` regardless of root level to reduce noise in INFO/DEBUG runs.
- **`netconfig_desktop/__main__.py`** — `_configure_logging()` called before
  `DesktopApp()`.  In frozen (installed) mode writes to
  `%APPDATA%\NetConfig\netconfig.log`; in dev mode uses console only.  Fatal startup
  exceptions now go through `logger.critical(..., exc_info=True)` before the message
  box so the stack trace is captured in the log file.
- **`netconfig_desktop/server.py`** — `log_config=None` added to `uvicorn.Config` so
  uvicorn's startup does not call `logging.config.dictConfig()` and overwrite the root
  logger configuration set by `configure_logging()`.
- **`netconfig_desktop/settings.py`** — `log_level` default raised from `"warning"` to
  `"info"` so desktop INFO logs reach the file handler.

### Changed (logging)

- **`netconfig/api/routes/backups.py`** — Device backup failures upgraded from
  `WARNING` to `ERROR` and now include `exc_info=True` for full traceback capture.
- **`netconfig/api/routes/configs.py`** — Added module logger; all three endpoints now
  emit structured log records (`DEBUG` for list/get, `INFO` for delete success,
  `WARNING` for 404 paths).
- **`netconfig/api/routes/definitions.py`** — Added module logger; reload endpoint
  logs loaded count and source directory at `INFO`.
- **`netconfig/storage/file_store.py`** — Added module logger; `save()` logs filename
  and byte count at `INFO`, `list_configs()` at `DEBUG`, `delete()` at `INFO`.
- **`netconfig_desktop/app.py`** — Lifecycle events (start, server ready, quit, window
  closed) logged at `INFO`.
- **`netconfig_desktop/tray.py`** — Added module logger; `run_detached()` at `DEBUG`,
  Show/Quit callbacks at `DEBUG`/`INFO`, `stop()` exception swallowed at `DEBUG`
  (was silent).
- **`netconfig_desktop/window.py`** — Added module logger; `create()` and `start()` at
  `INFO`, show/hide/destroy at `DEBUG`, `on_closed` callback exception at `DEBUG`
  (was silent).

### Tests (logging)

- `tests/unit/test_logging_config.py` — 17 new unit tests across three classes:
  `TestConfigureLoggingBasic` (handler type, levels, idempotency),
  `TestFileHandler` (rotating handler, directory creation, write-through),
  `TestNoisyLoggerSuppression` (third-party loggers capped at WARNING, netconfig.*
  left at NOTSET).  `reset_root_logger` autouse fixture restores root logger state
  after each test.

---

### Security

- **Credential encryption at rest** (`netconfig/security/credentials.py`) —
  Device passwords and enable passwords are now encrypted with Fernet
  symmetric encryption before being written to disk.  The key is stored in
  the OS secure credential store (Windows Credential Manager / macOS Keychain
  / Linux SecretService) via the `keyring` library.  Existing plaintext
  profiles and schedule device lists are automatically migrated to encrypted
  storage on first load.  In-memory model objects always hold plaintext;
  encryption is a storage-layer concern only.
- **Path traversal protection** (`netconfig/storage/file_store.py`) —
  `resolve_path()` now rejects any filename that does not match the expected
  naming convention regex before touching the filesystem.  Both the
  subdirectory and flat-fallback paths are verified to lie inside the storage
  root via `Path.resolve().is_relative_to()`.
- **Open-in-editor extension whitelist** (`netconfig/api/routes/configs.py`) —
  `POST /api/v1/configs/{filename}/open` now checks the file extension against
  an explicit allowlist (`{.cfg, .conf, .txt, .xml, .log}`) and returns 400
  for any other type, preventing the OS handler from being invoked on
  executables or other unintended file types.
- **Host field validation** (`netconfig/models/device.py`,
  `netconfig/models/device_profile.py`) — `DeviceTarget.host`,
  `DeviceProfileCreate.host`, and `DeviceProfileUpdate.host` now validate
  against `ipaddress.ip_address()` or an RFC-1123 hostname regex.  Shell
  metacharacters, path separators, and other invalid values are rejected
  with HTTP 422.
- **Passwords removed from HTML DOM** — `data-password` /
  `data-enable-password` attributes removed from the Dashboard
  `<option>` elements (`index.html`).  Credentials are fetched via
  `GET /api/v1/devices/{id}` when a saved device is selected.  The
  `data-profile` attribute on Devices page cards (`devices.html`) no
  longer includes credential fields; `runDeviceBackup()` fetches the full
  profile from the API on demand.
- **Data directories added to `.gitignore`** — `devices/`, `schedules/`,
  `jobs/`, and `configs/` are now excluded from version control to prevent
  credential-bearing files from being committed.
- **`cryptography>=41.0.0` and `keyring>=24.0.0`** added to
  `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` dependencies.
- **`SECURITY.md`** — new document describing the security architecture,
  threat model, implemented controls, and known limitations.  Must be kept
  up-to-date with any security-relevant change.

### Tests (security)

- `tests/unit/test_credentials.py` — 18 tests covering key initialisation
  (first run, cached reload, idempotent), `encrypt`/`decrypt` round-trip
  (empty string, unicode, uniqueness per call), `InvalidToken` on garbage
  input, and `decrypt_field()` migration helper (encrypted→True,
  plaintext→False, empty→False).
- `tests/unit/test_storage.py` → `TestResolvePathSecurity` — 7 tests
  covering `../` traversal, `.cfg`-suffixed traversal, absolute paths,
  subdir-relative paths, empty string, and a positive case asserting the
  resolved path stays inside the storage root.
- `tests/unit/test_models.py` → `TestDeviceTarget` — 7 host validation tests:
  IPv4, IPv6, hostname accepted; `../`, `/`, space, semicolon rejected.
- `tests/integration/test_configs_api.py` → `TestOpenConfig` — 2 new tests
  for extension whitelist (`.exe`, `.zip` → 400).
- `tests/integration/test_configs_api.py` → `TestPathTraversal` — 4 new
  tests: `../../etc/passwd` GET/DELETE → 404, `.cfg`-suffixed traversal →
  404, absolute path → 404.

### Added (device profiles)

- **`DeviceProfile` model** (`netconfig/models/device_profile.py`) — stores
  profile metadata: `id` (UUID), `name`, `type_key`, `host`, `port`, `username`,
  `password`, `enable_password` (optional), `notes` (optional), `created_at`.
  `DeviceProfileCreate` and `DeviceProfileUpdate` companion models.
- **`FileDeviceProfileStore`** (`netconfig/storage/device_profile_store.py`) —
  persists profiles as JSON under `{data_root}/devices/{id}.json`.
- **`GET/POST /api/v1/devices/`** and **`GET/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/devices/{id}`** —
  full CRUD for device profiles.
- **`GET /devices`** — Devices page listing all profiles as collapsible cards.
  Each card shows name, type badge, host, backup count, and actions (▶ Backup /
  Edit / Delete).  Expanding the card reveals a per-config history table.
  Inline edit panel (`device-edit-panel`) allows credential updates without
  leaving the page.
- **Dashboard — saved device select** (`data-testid="device-profile-select"`) —
  selecting a saved profile pre-fills all form fields.  Optional "Save as Profile"
  name input (`data-testid="device-profile-name-input"`) creates or links a profile
  when the backup form is submitted.
- **`ConfigRecord.device_profile_id`** — new optional field linking a stored
  config to the device profile that produced it.  Persisted as a sidecar
  `{filename}.meta.json` alongside each config file; sidecar is cleaned up on
  delete.  `list_configs()` reads sidecars to populate the field.
- **`BackupSchedule` — two-pronged targeting** — `target_type_keys: list[str]`
  (back up all profiles of matching types) and `target_device_ids: list[str]`
  (back up specific profile UUIDs); mix is permitted.  Inline `devices` list
  retained for backward compatibility.  `ScheduleCreate` validates that at least
  one target field is non-empty.
- **`GET /devices` nav link** added between Dashboard and Jobs.
  Order: Dashboard | Devices | Jobs | Schedules | Configs | Definitions | API Docs.

### Fixed (View / Download buttons — WebView compatibility)

- **`base.html`** — Added shared `viewConfig(filename)` function (fetches config
  and displays it in a new inline modal), `downloadConfig(filename)` function
  (blob-based download, works in Qt WebEngine where `<a download>` is unreliable),
  and `closeConfigViewer()`.  New config viewer modal (`#_config-viewer`) added to
  the base layout; closes on backdrop click or Escape key.
- **`configs.html`** — View (`config-view-link`) and Download (`config-download-btn`)
  changed from `<a target="_blank">` / `<a download>` to `<button>` elements
  calling `viewConfig()` / `downloadConfig()`.  Added `DOMContentLoaded` hash
  handler: navigating to `/configs#{filename}` scrolls to the matching row,
  briefly highlights it, and auto-opens the viewer modal.
- **`jobs.html`** — View (`job-config-view-link`) changed from
  `<a href="/api/v1/configs/…" target="_blank">` to `<a href="/configs#{filename}">`
  so clicking View on a job result navigates to the Configs tab with the file
  pre-selected.  Download (`job-config-download-btn`) changed from `<a download>`
  to `<button onclick="downloadConfig(…)">`.
- **`devices.html`** — Same View / Download fix as `configs.html` applied to the
  per-device config history table.

### Fixed

- **`configs.html`** — Post-delete empty-check used CSS selector `.config-row`
  (no such class) instead of `[data-testid="config-row"]`, causing the page to
  reload after *every* deletion rather than only when the last config was removed.
- **`base.html`** — Removed orphaned `.badge-success` CSS rule that duplicated
  `.badge-completed` and leaked device-result vocabulary into the job-level badge
  namespace.

### Added

- **`POST /api/v1/definitions/reload`** — New API endpoint that re-reads all YAML
  files from `definitions_dir` and replaces the in-memory registry without a server
  restart.  Returns `{ "loaded": N, "type_keys": [...] }`.
- **Definitions page** — "↻ Reload" button (`data-testid="def-reload-btn"`) that
  calls the new reload endpoint and refreshes the page on success.
- **Configs page** — "View" link (`data-testid="config-view-link"`) and download
  button (`data-testid="config-download-btn"`) are now separate explicit actions in
  the Actions column.  The filename cell is now plain text.
- **Toast notifications** (`data-testid="toast"`) — Global `showToast(msg, type)`
  function in `base.html` replaces all `alert()` calls with a non-blocking,
  auto-dismissing notification (4 s timeout).  Types: `info`, `success`, `error`.
- **Inline job results** — After a backup job completes, per-device results
  (host, type, success/failure, error message) are rendered directly in the status
  banner.  The recent-jobs table row is injected by JS; no full-page reload occurs.
- **Active nav state** — Current page is highlighted in the navbar
  (`class="active"`, `aria-current="page"`).  `active_page` context variable added
  to all three UI route responses in `main.py`.
- **UTC timestamp localisation** — All `[data-utc]` elements are converted to
  browser-local time on `DOMContentLoaded` via a global script in `base.html`.
  Server-rendered fallback (UTC string) is preserved for non-JS contexts.
- **Enable Password conditional visibility** — The Enable Password field is shown
  only for device types where `connection.needs_enable` is `true`.  Driven by
  `data-needs-enable` attributes on `<option>` elements; toggled on type change.
- **Port collapsed to Advanced** — The SSH port field (default 22, rarely changed)
  is now inside a `<details>` summary labelled "⚙ Port", reducing visual noise in
  the backup form.
- **Inline delete confirmation** — The Delete button on the Configs page now shows
  an in-row "Delete? Yes / No" prompt instead of the browser's native `confirm()`
  dialog (which can be suppressed in embedded WebView contexts).
- **Empty-state guidance** — All three pages now include actionable text in their
  empty states rather than bare declarative messages.

### Changed

- **Nav brand** (`data-testid="nav-brand"`) changed from `<span>` to `<a href="/">`
  so clicking the product name navigates home, per standard convention.
- **Submit button** (`data-testid="submit-backup-btn"`) is now disabled and labelled
  "Running…" while a backup job is in flight, preventing double-submission.
- **Polling error handling** — The job-status polling `setInterval` now counts
  consecutive fetch failures and stops after 3, showing a toast instead of silently
  looping forever.
- **Jobs table** — "Devices" column removed (redundant with "Success / Total"
  denominator).  "Job ID" column is now plain text (`data-testid="job-id-text"`)
  rather than a link to the raw JSON API response.  "Created (UTC)" header
  simplified to "Created" (timestamps are localised by JS).
- **Configs table** — "Captured (UTC)" column header simplified to "Captured".
  Filename column is now plain text; view/download actions moved to the Actions
  column.
- **Definitions table** — "Strategy" column renamed to "Collection"; strategy
  values are now human-readable ("SSH (Netmiko)", "SSH (Shell)") rather than
  internal Python identifiers.  "Ext" column header renamed to "File Ext".
  Notes cell gains a `title` tooltip showing the full (untruncated) text.
- **`button:disabled`** CSS rule added to `base.html` — disabled buttons now show
  `opacity: 0.6` and `cursor: not-allowed` globally.
- **E2E test** `test_submit_completes_and_page_reloads` renamed to
  `test_submit_completes_and_shows_job_in_table` and updated to assert that the
  jobs table becomes visible via JS injection (no `wait_for_load_state` needed).
- **Remove device button** gains `aria-label="Remove this device"` for
  accessibility.

### Tests

- `tests/integration/test_definitions_api.py` — Added `TestReloadDefinitions`
  (5 tests): 200 response, loaded count, type_keys list, post-reload registry
  accessibility, idempotency.
- `tests/testid_reference.md` — Updated for all new/changed testids: `toast`,
  `job-id-text` (replaces `job-link`), `config-view-link` (moved to Actions),
  `config-download-btn`, `config-delete-confirm-btn`, `config-delete-cancel-btn`,
  `def-reload-btn`.  Notes added for conditional visibility and `data-utc`.
