``/api/v1/migration`` routes.

Phase 0 surfaces only read-only introspection:

    GET  /api/v1/migration/adapters
        → list of AdapterInfo (one entry per registered adapter)

    GET  /api/v1/migration/adapters/{name}/capabilities
        → the full CapabilityMatrix

Phase 2 will add ``POST /plan``, ``/render``, ``/deploy`` and a
sibling ``MigrationJob`` persistence layer analogous to ``FileJobStore``.
