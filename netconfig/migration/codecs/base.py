"""
Adapter contract: :class:`CodecBase` + :class:`CapabilityMatrix`.

Every vendor adapter subclasses :class:`CodecBase` and ships:

    * ``name`` — unique, used as the adapter key in requests and URLs.
    * ``capabilities`` — a :class:`CapabilityMatrix` describing what
      paths the adapter can round-trip.
    * ``parse(raw)`` — convert a raw config string into an
      adapter-internal (Phase 0) or canonical-YANG-tree (Phase 0.5+)
      representation.
    * ``render(tree)`` — emit a raw config string from the tree.

The contract's key invariant is the round-trip::

    adapter.parse(adapter.render(tree)) == tree

for every tree in the adapter's supported subset.  Adapters must test
this explicitly; see ``tests/unit/migration/test_mock_adapter.py`` for
the reference pattern.

Thread-safety: adapters are instantiated fresh per call by the
registry; instances are stateless unless documented otherwise.
